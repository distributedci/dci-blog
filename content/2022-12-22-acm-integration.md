Summary: ACM is a tool that allows deploying, and managing OCP clusters and workloads on top of it. Now the DCI Agent has the support to automate the creation of SNO instances by the integration of the ACM roles.

[TOC]

## ACM in DCI

[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management) (ACM) controls and deploys Openshift clusters.

ACM provides:

* SNO and multi-node cluster deployments.
* Built-in security policies.
* Allows deploying applications.
* Enforces policies across infrastructure platforms.
* Resources governance.
* An easy-to-use console.

ACM is an easy method to deploy and manage OCP clusters. Now DCI supports installing SNO instances using ACM.

## ACM architecture

ACM is available in the Red Hat Catalog, installing it is just a matter of creating a subscription, then create a multi-cluster engine resource and wait for the installation to complete. It requires a storage class that will store information about the managed clusters.

We will use the following ACM terminology to refer to the two kinds of clusters:

- Hub: The cluster running the ACM operator.
- Spoke: The cluster(s) deployed/managed by the Hub.

## The ACM Ansible Roles

The dci-openshift-agent uses two roles to deploy a Hub and Spoke clusters.

- The [acm-setup](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/master/roles/acm-setup/README.md) role validates the requirements, deploys and configures the ACM operator. This operator provides a graphical console to perform its management.

- The [acm-sno](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/master/roles/acm-sno/README.md) role interacts with the Hub to request and deploy an SNO instance, from installation to importing the resource into the ACM console.

The roles do not have any dependency, as the only requirement to execute them is to provide a KUBECONFIG file as input. This file will allow interaction with the Openshift clusters. Some examples of how to use the roles for multiple scenarios are available on the corresponding roleâ€™s readme.

## The integration with DCI

Creating the roles was the first stage, after that we included them as part of the skeleton of the DCI Agent. This is to take advantage of the known benefits of using DCI to deploy and test OCP.

The DCI Agent takes care of the following tasks and generates some of the parameters passed to the ACM roles.

* Performs the OCP release mirroring.
* Downloads container images and ISOs for disconnected environments. In connected-mode, it identifies the asset's URL in public repositories.
* Saves logging information and collects cluster information.
* Deploys OLM operators.

## What is next?

We had a fast overview of the  ACM and some generalities about its integration with DCI. We are going to dedicate some blog posts on this matter, so if you have an interest in giving it a try, please take a look to [using ACM to deploy SNO](acm-deploy-sno.html).
