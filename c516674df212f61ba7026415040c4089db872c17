Something like: Recently we received 10 brand new, nice, and powerful servers where it was decided to integrate them as part of our CI jobs. That will allow us to have parallel deployments, dedicated server for troubleshooting, and testing, etc. \n\nSome of the challenges were:\n - Defined the network layout in a flat network\n - Allow connectivity between all clusters\n - Setting up shared network services (DHCP, DNS)\n - Having a single point to manage all cluster deployments\n\netc. Just some ideas... but feel free to ignore them if do not make sense ðŸ˜Š\nMaybe concentrating all the background stuff here.",
